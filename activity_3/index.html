                Po-tay-toes! Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.

                Zero stars. Horrible. I followed a recipe to prepare them and all I changed was using the lava I had handy to cook them because my oven was broken. I don't know who would like these crunchy black things.
